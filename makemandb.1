.Sh NAME
.Nm makemandb
.Nd Parse the man pages and build mandb.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl flo
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility traverses the list of directories containing man pages, parses them 
with the help of libmandoc and builds an Sqlite database apropos.db to support 
full text searches. It obtains this list of directories using the 
.Op Fl p
option of 
.Xr man 1
.Pp
Its supports following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Force rebuilding the index from scratch, pruning the existing one.
.It Fl l
Limit the parsing to only the NAME section of the pages. This option 
can be used to mimic the behaviour of the classic
.Xr apropos 1
and also save disk space substantially.
.It Fl o
Use this option to optimize the index so that the search is fast and also 
it drops the disk space usage significantly, but this is a somewhat expensive 
operation.
.El
.Pp
As the database file is stored under
.Pa /var/db
, therefore to run
.Nm
root privileges are required.
.Pp
.Ss DATABASE SCHEMA
The name of the FTS table is mandb and it's schema is as follows:
.Bl -column -offset indent "Column Name" "Column Description"
.It Li section Ta The section number of the page
.It Li name Ta The name of the page from NAME section.
.It Li name_desc Ta The one line description from NAME section.
.It Li desc Ta The DESCRIPTION section.
