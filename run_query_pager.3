.In apropos-utils.h
.Ft int
.Fn run_query_pager "sqlite3 *db" "query_args *args"

but with following two differences.
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It Li
.Nm
will return a 5 column result set, much like

query_args args;
FILE *pager = popen("more", "w");
char *errmsg = NULL;
const char **sec_nums = {NULL, "2", "3", NUll, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL};
args.search_str = argv[1];
args.sec_nums = sec_nums;
args.nrec = "10";
args.callback = &query_callback;
args.callback_data = (void *)pager;
args.errmsg = &errmsg;
if (run_query(db, &args) < 0)
		errx(EXIT_FAILURE, "%s", errmsg);
}

free(query);
free(errmsg);
pclose(pager);

static int
query_callback(void *data, int ncol, char **col_values, char **col_names)
{
	FILE *out = (FILE *) data;
	char *html_result = col_values[0];
	fprintf(out, "%s\n", html_result);
	return 0;
}
