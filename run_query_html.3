and returns the results in HTML format which can be
processed inside a callback function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In apropos-utils.h
.Ft int
.Fn run_query_html "sqlite3 *db" "query_args *args"

.Fn run_query
but with the following two differences.
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It Li
.Nm
takes only two arguments.
.It Li
.Nm
will return a single column result set, unlike
.Xr run_query 3
which returns a 5 column result set.
.It Li
The value returned by
.Nm
in the callback function is in HTML format, enclosed between <p> and </p> tags.
.El
For more details, refer to the manual page of
.Xr run_query 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful execution the
.Fn run_query_html
function will return 0 and in case of an error \-1 will be returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width -compact
.It Pa /var/db/man.db
The Sqlite FTS database which maintains an index of the manual pages.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Following is a code excerpt of how
.Nm
can be used.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <apropos-utils.h>
query_args args;
char *errmsg = NULL;
const char **sec_nums = {NULL, "2", "3", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL};
args.search_str = argv[1];
args.sec_nums = sec_nums;
args.nrec = "10";
args.callback = &query_callback;
args.callback_data = NULL;
args.errmsg = &errmsg;
if (run_query(db, &args) < 0)
		errx(EXIT_FAILURE, "%s", errmsg);
}

free(query);
free(errmsg);

static int
query_callback(void *data, int ncol, char **col_values, char **col_names)
{
	char *html_result = col_values[0];
	fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", html_result);
	return 0;
}
