There are three tables in the database at present:

(1) mandb:
    This is the main FTS table which contains all the content from 
    man pages

  COLUMN NAME       DESCRIPTION
  1. section        Section number of the page  
  2. name           The name of the page  
  3. name_desc      The one line description from the NAME section  
  4. desc           Contains the content from DESCRIPTION 
                    section and any other section which 
                    is not indexed in a separate column.

  12. errors        ERRORS section

(2) mandb_md5:
    This table contains md5 hashes of all the indexed man 
    pages. This is there to make sure we do not index 
    the same man page twice, i.e. to prevent indexing 
    hardlinks.

  COLUMN NAME       DESCRIPTION
  md5_hash          MD5 Hash of the man page
  id                A unique integer ID for the page, which
                    refers to a page in mandb (Implicit foreign 
                    key?)

(3) mandb_links:
    This is an index of all the hard/soft links of the man 
    pages. The list of the linked pages is usually obtained 
    from the multiple .Nm entries in the page.

  Column Name       Description
  1. link           The name of the hard/soft link  
  2. target         Name of the target page to which it points  
  3. section        The section number  
  4. machine        The machine architecture (if any) for which 
                    the page is relevant
